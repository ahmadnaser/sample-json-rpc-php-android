Sample code for blog post "Android JSON-RPC client and PHP Zend Framework server"
============================

Companion code for blog post ["Android JSON-RPC client and PHP Zend Framework server"](http://www.codeforest.net/android-json-rpc-client-and-php-zend-framework-server).

XML-RPC rules, but the amount of data it generates is its big disadvantage. This is where JSON-RPC steps in. Data it generates is significally smaller, but this isnâ€™t suprising as JSON is known as fat free XML.

Follow-up on ["How to build PHP XML-RPC Server, Client and Android application"](http://www.codeforest.net/how-to-build-php-xml-rpc-server-client-and-android-app) blog post, this time we are using JSON-RPC and also measuring which one was faster and had smaller data packages.
